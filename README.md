## CMPG-323-Project2---31884288
# We will be concentrating on the creation of an API in this project, which is the second of the semester.
## Project Discription
# The creation of a Web API that communicates with the Microsoft Entity Framework and Swagger for documentation will be our second project of the semester. For my project, I'll be creating the CRUD (CREATE, READ, DELETE, and UPDATE) method, which will connect to a database containing data from IoT devices. In order to get the project going, I had to use Visual Studio,.NET CORE 3.1, and the supplied SQL database.
## Use of Stakeholders
# The user would need to register their credentials through the register model after authorisation was in place in order to be able to run the endpoints. For access, JWT Authentication will generate a token that will be valid for at least an hour.
